# Claude Project Notes

## Workflow
- **Always fix the problem at hand first**, then worry about the build
- Don't run build checks until the fix is complete and ready to verify

## Commit Messages
- **NEVER** mention "Claude" in commit messages
- Do not include "Co-Authored-By: Claude" lines
- Keep commit messages professional and focused on the changes made
