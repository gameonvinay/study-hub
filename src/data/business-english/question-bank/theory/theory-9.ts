## 1. Direct (Deductive) Approach

### Definition
The **direct approach** presents the main conclusion, recommendation, or findings at the beginning, followed by supporting details and evidence.

✓ Effective for busy executives
✓ Direct and efficient communication

### Example: Sales Performance Report

**Opening (Direct Conclusion):**
"Sales increased by 25% in Q4 2023, exceeding our annual target by $2 million. This success was driven primarily by strong performance in the Northeast region and the successful launch of our new product line."

**Supporting Details:**
- Regional breakdown showing Northeast led with 40% growth
- Product line analysis showing new products contributed 60% of additional revenue
- Marketing campaign impact statistics

**Evidence:**
- Sales figures by month

## 2. Indirect (Inductive) Approach
