## Visual Representation

## How the Johari Window Changes

### Expanding the Open Pane

The goal of the Johari Window is to **expand the OPEN pane** while **reducing the other three panes**.

**Two Key Processes:**

1. **Self-Disclosure** (Reduces Hidden Pane)
   - Sharing information about yourself
   - Being more open and transparent
   - Trusting others with personal information
   - Moves information from Hidden to Open

2. **Feedback** (Reduces Blind Pane)
   - Receiving input from others
   - Listening to observations about yourself
   - Accepting others' perceptions
   - Moves information from Blind to Open

3. **Shared Discovery** (Reduces Unknown Pane)
   - Mutual exploration
   - Group activities and experiences
   - Collaborative learning
   - New situations and challenges
   - Moves information from Unknown to Open

## Conclusion

The Johari Window is a powerful framework for understanding self-awareness and interpersonal relationships. The four panes—Open (known to self and others), Blind (unknown to self, known to others), Hidden (known to self, unknown to others), and Unknown (unknown to both)—represent different aspects of human awareness and interaction. By actively working to expand the Open pane through self-disclosure and soliciting feedback, while exploring the Unknown through new experiences, individuals and teams can achieve greater authenticity, improved communication, and stronger relationships. Whether used for personal development, team building, leadership training, or organizational improvement, the Johari Window remains a relevant and valuable tool for enhancing human interaction and self-understanding in both personal and professional contexts.`
