**Knapp's Relational Development Model**, created by communication scholar Mark L. Knapp, describes the stages of relationship development and deterioration. The model consists of 10 stages divided into two major phases: **Coming Together** (relationship building) and **Coming Apart** (relationship deterioration).

---

## Overview of Knapp's Model

The model illustrates how relationships progress through predictable stages, moving either toward greater intimacy (coming together) or toward dissolution (coming apart). Understanding these stages helps in recognizing relationship patterns and communication dynamics.

## Important Points About the Model

### 1. **Not All Relationships Follow All Stages**
- Relationships can stabilize at any stage
- Not every relationship reaches bonding
- Not every deterioration goes through all stages

### 2. **Movement is Not Always Linear**
- Relationships can move backward or forward
- Couples can skip stages or revisit earlier ones
- Progress can pause at any stage

### 3. **Duration Varies**
- Time spent in each stage differs by relationship
- Some relationships move quickly, others slowly
- Cultural and individual factors affect pacing

### 4. **Repair is Possible**
- Relationships in "coming apart" can return to "coming together"
- Intervention and effort can reverse deterioration
- Awareness of stages helps in relationship management

## Conclusion

Knapp's Relational Development Model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how relationships evolve over time. The flowchart visualization clearly shows the progression from initiating contact through bonding at the peak, and potentially through differentiation to termination. By recognizing these stages, individuals can better navigate their relationships, identify problems early, and take action to maintain or improve relationship quality. Whether in personal or professional contexts, understanding this model enables more effective communication and relationship management throughout all phases of relational development.`
